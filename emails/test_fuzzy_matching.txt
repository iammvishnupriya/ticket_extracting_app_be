We have an urgnt isue with the CK Alumi portal that needs immedaite attention. The system is showing erors when users try to access their profiles.

This is a critcal bug that affects all users and requires an enhancment to fix the underlying problm. The impact is high priorit as it's blocking user access.

Please investigate this isue and provide a solution as soon as possible.
